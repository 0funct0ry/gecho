   - [ ] `--cert` - Path to TLS certificate
   - [ ] `--key` - Path to TLS private key
   - [ ] `--log-level` - Set logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)
   - [ ] `--log-file` - Path to log file
   - [ ] `--admin-port` - Port for admin web interface
   - [ ] `--admin-interface` - Interface for admin web interface
   - [ ] `--admin-auth` - Enable authentication for admin interface

`gecho` is a **multi-threaded TCP echo server written in Go**, designed to test connectivity and communication in environments like **Kubernetes clusters**.

It listens for incoming TCP connections and responds with `ECHO [<request-line>]`. If the client sends the command `quit`, the server responds with `Bye` and closes the connection.
